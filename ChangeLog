	Again better Mime-type detection for OLE2 streams.

Mon Sep 26 20:44:10 PDT 2005
	Minor improvements to the PDF extractor:
	- first change is to avoid outputting keywords with empty values
  	  (for now the new check is only effective when the value is seen
	  as a string of 8-bit characters; I'm not sure how to rewrite it
	  for the Unicode case in the if branch just above.)
        - second change is to remap PDF Creator as 'software' keyword
          instead of 'creator'.

	Releasing libextractor 0.5.6.

Fri Sep 16 16:41:04 PDT 2005

	decompression from man and tar extractors.
	Releasing libextractor 0.5.5.

Sun Sep  4 02:08:56 PDT 2005

	Bugfixes in exiv2 extractor fixing remaining issues.
	Changed plugins to not use filename but always only
	rely on mmapped memory.  Extended API with function
	that allows running getKeywords on data in memory
	(instead of filename).  Extended API with encode
	and decode functions for binary metadata.
	Releasing libextractor 0.5.2.

Mon Jul  4 18:10:14 CEST 2005
	Preliminary integration of exiv2 support (not enabled

	bindings into separate packages.
	Releasing libextractor 0.5.1.

Wed Jun 29 15:37:51 CEST 2005
	Finally found out how to disable building static libs.

	static version of the plugins is pretty, well, useless.

Sat Jun 18 14:56:38 EST 2005
	Fixed a score of compiler warnings and some minor bugs,
	none of which should have been observable.

	Fixed some minor build issues.  Releasing libextractor 0.3.7.

Tue Sep 14 21:25:22 EST 2004
	Improved performance of the HTML extractor by avoiding parsing
	after the header (factor of 25 improvement for a 4 MB HTML file
	resulting in a total improvement for total extraction time for
	running all extractors of about 50%).  Improved performance
	of the ZIP extractor for non-zip files by testing for the ZIP
	header before trying to locate the central directory (for 5 MB
	/dev/random time improves by a factor of about 15).  Same change
	was also applied to the OO extractor (since OO is effectively a
	zip).  Overall improvement for 5 MB /dev/random for running
	all extractors is a factor of 10 (now takes 100ms on my machine
	to run 720 times on the same 5 MB file passing that file as an
	argument; the remaining time is pretty much doing 720x mmap and
	related system calls).

	already basically functional.  Releasing 0.3.0
